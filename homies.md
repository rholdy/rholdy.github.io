**Fine Print**
{: #fine-print-title }

I'm not being paid to promote any of these roles (although if someone offered, I'd sell out and take the money immediately -- So if you ever see a job post on here for the New York Yankees, you'll know thats what happened). 
{: #fine-print }

If you'd like your job included or removed, drop me a line.

If you're browsing feel free to apply directly to any role, or drop me a line if you want an intro.
